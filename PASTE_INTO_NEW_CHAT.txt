I need to continue the Jorge Real Estate Bots integration project.

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ Phase 1 COMPLETE - All 3 critical files integrated and tested
✅ Production APIs running: localhost:8001 (API) and localhost:8503 (Dashboard)
✅ MVP enhanced with production features: PerformanceCache, JorgeBusinessRules, Enhanced LeadAnalyzer, KPI Dashboard, FastAPI upgrades
✅ All tests passing: 0.19ms cache hits, 489ms AI analysis, 100% 5-minute rule compliance

PROJECTS:
1. Production System: ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/
   - API: http://localhost:8001 (RUNNING ✅ - validated with 339ms response)
   - Dashboard: http://localhost:8503 (RUNNING ✅ - 47 conversations, 8 hot leads, $125K pipeline)
   - Status: jorge_claude_intelligence.py bug FIXED at line 450

2. MVP System: ~/Documents/GitHub/jorge_real_estate_bots/
   - Branch: feature/integrate-production-phase1
   - Git commits: 8 commits, ~1,200 lines of production code integrated
   - Status: Phase 1 complete, all tests passing

MISSION FOR THIS SESSION - PHASE 2:
Extract 3 high-value files from production to MVP (estimated: 6-8 hours):

1. lead_intelligence_optimized.py (980+ lines)
   - Pattern-based lead scoring (no AI needed for simple cases)
   - Budget/timeline/location extraction with regex
   - Fast fallback when Claude unavailable
   - Reduces API costs significantly

2. jorge_seller_bot.py (543 lines)
   - Q1-Q4 framework for seller qualification
   - Timeline/Motivation/Condition/Strategy questions
   - State machine conversation flow
   - CMA trigger automation

3. ghl_client.py (347 lines)
   - Complete GoHighLevel API wrapper
   - Contact management, custom fields, SMS/email
   - Opportunity management, rate limiting
   - Production-tested, more complete than MVP version

PLEASE READ THESE FILES FIRST:
1. ~/Documents/GitHub/jorge_real_estate_bots/PHASE1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
2. ~/Documents/GitHub/jorge_real_estate_bots/NEW_SESSION_HANDOFF.md
3. ~/Documents/GitHub/EnterpriseHub/jorge_deployment_package/USEFUL_CODE_ANALYSIS.md

THEN START PHASE 2:
Begin with extracting lead_intelligence_optimized.py pattern-based intelligence as AI fallback.

Let's continue building the enterprise-grade Jorge Bot platform! 🚀
