I'm continuing Phase 3B implementation for the Jorge Real Estate AI dashboard.

**Context**: Phase 3A (core dashboard with mock data) is incomplete. I need to implement Phase 3B (Priority 2) advanced analytics features with real data integration.

**Architecture Designed**: Full service layer architecture has been designed with:
- MetricsService (performance aggregation)
- DashboardDataService (data orchestration)
- PerformanceTracker (real-time stats)
- 4 new dashboard components (performance, filters, conversations, commission)
- Redis-backed persistence for seller bot states
- Multi-tier caching strategy (30s-1hr TTL)

**Current Status**:
✅ Code Explorer analysis complete (found Phase 3A incomplete, no service layer)
✅ Code Architect design complete (full architecture blueprint)
⏳ Ready to implement

**What I Need You To Do**:
1. Read PHASE3B_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md for full context
2. Read PHASE3_DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md for requirements
3. Start with Phase 1 (Foundation - 2 hours)
4. Follow TDD workflow for each component
5. Use existing patterns: async/await, dataclasses, Plotly, CacheService

**Implementation Checklist**:

Phase 1: Foundation (2 hours)
- [ ] Create models/dashboard_models.py with 12 dataclasses
- [ ] Implement services/performance_tracker.py
- [ ] Enhance CacheService with metrics tracking
- [ ] Write unit tests

Phase 2: Service Layer (2 hours)
- [ ] Build services/metrics_service.py
- [ ] Build services/dashboard_data_service.py
- [ ] Add persistence to SellerBotService
- [ ] Write unit tests (80%+ coverage)

Phase 3: UI Components (2.5 hours)
- [ ] Create primitives (skeleton_loader, error_card, animated_metric)
- [ ] Build dashboards/performance_analytics.py
- [ ] Build dashboards/interactive_filters.py
- [ ] Build dashboards/active_conversations.py
- [ ] Build dashboards/commission_tracking.py

Phase 4: Integration (1 hour)
- [ ] Create pages/dashboard_v2.py
- [ ] Add CSS animations and styling
- [ ] Implement error boundaries and loading states

Phase 5: Testing (0.5 hours)
- [ ] Run full test suite (pytest)
- [ ] Manual testing (all features)
- [ ] Code review with feature-dev:code-reviewer agent

**Critical Files to Read First**:
1. PHASE3B_IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF.md (complete handoff)
2. PHASE3_DASHBOARD_SPECIFICATION.md (requirements)
3. command_center/dashboard.py (current implementation)
4. bots/shared/cache_service.py (caching patterns)

**Environment**:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/jorge_real_estate_bots
source venv/bin/activate
```

Start with Phase 1: Create `ghl_real_estate_ai/models/dashboard_models.py` with 12 dataclasses. Use TDD (write tests first).
